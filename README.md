# data_products_coursera

This is the Shiny app for the Data Products module.

The data employed was the ALCOHOL data set from the "robustbase" library.
It details the solubility of various alcohols in water. Some alcohols (such as the one that is in beer, ethanol) are perfectly miscible
Others will float on water, just like oil.

In the app, I have taken 41 of the 44 alcohol data points and constructed a predictive model of their solubility based on their charcteristics

The interactive part involves choosing one of the three remaining alcohols using the drop down menu and see where it lies on the prediction vs measured line.

This app could in theory allow one to decide quickly if an alcohol was miscible with water (Important in chemical reactions)
